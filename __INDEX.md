# Anything Goes
*The blog platform where the posts are written by the readers.*

Anything Goes is a social experiment sort of thing. It allows the readers of the blog to write posts by just adding a markdown file
(including this one!) to a GitHub repository. The repository is available to visit by clicking `Create a Post` in the top right.
